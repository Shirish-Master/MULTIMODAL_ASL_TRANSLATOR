# ASL-WLASL Converter: Technical Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

The ASL-WLASL Converter is built as a bidirectional translation system between written English text and American Sign Language (ASL) videos. The architecture consists of two main conversion pipelines:

### 1. Text to ASL Video Pipeline

The Text-to-ASL conversion follows these processing steps:

#### Text Processing & Segmentation
- **Text Normalization**: Input text is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed
- **Tokenization**: Text is split into individual words
- **Function Word Filtering**: Common function words (articles, prepositions, etc.) are removed, as these often have no direct ASL equivalent
- **ASL Gloss Creation**: The words are arranged in an approximation of ASL grammar (simplified for this implementation)

#### Video Lookup & Selection
- **Word-to-Video Mapping**: Each word in the gloss is searched in the WLASL database
- **Video Selection Algorithm**: For each word, the system selects a video from available options
  - Current implementation: Random selection from available videos for each word
  - Could be enhanced with quality metrics or signer consistency
- **Missing Word Handling**: Words without corresponding videos are tracked and reported

#### Video Processing & Concatenation
- **Video Loading**: Individual word videos are loaded using MoviePy's VideoFileClip
- **Video Normalization**: Videos are optionally resized to consistent dimensions (640x480)
- **Transition Generation**: Optional smooth transitions are added between clips
- **Video Compilation**: Videos are concatenated using MoviePy's concatenate_videoclips function
- **Output Generation**: Final video is written as MP4 with H.264 encoding

```python
# Core video stitching logic
clips = [VideoFileClip(path) for path in video_paths]
if include_transitions:
    final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="compose")
else:
    final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="chain")
final_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec="libx264", audio=False)
```

### 2. ASL Video to Text Pipeline

The ASL-to-Text recognition system demonstrates the following process:

#### Video Preprocessing
- **Frame Extraction**: Key frames are extracted from the input video
- **Frame Resizing**: Frames are resized to 224x224 (standard input size for many vision models)
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1]

#### Feature Extraction
- **Hand Region Detection**: In a full implementation, MediaPipe or similar would extract hand positions
- **Motion Tracking**: Temporal information about hand movements would be tracked
- **Feature Vector Generation**: Hand position and movement features would be combined

#### Sign Classification
- **Model Application**: Features would be passed to a trained classifier
- **Prediction Generation**: Top-k predictions with confidence scores are returned
- **Post-processing**: Optional filtering or context-based corrections

```python
# Classification simulation (in a full implementation, this would use an actual model)
predictions = []
for i in range(min(top_k, len(available_words))):
    # Generate confidence scores that decrease for lower ranks
    confidence = max(0.1, 0.9 - (i * 0.2) + (random.random() * 0.1))
    predictions.append((words[i], confidence))
```

## Dataset Implementation

The system uses the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset:

### Dataset Structure
- **JSON Metadata**: Contains information about all signs, including:
  - Gloss terms (English words)
  - Video instances for each word
  - Signer information
  - Split designation (train/test)
- **Video Files**: Individual MP4 files for each sign instance

### Dataset Access Layer
The `WLASLDataset` class provides the following functionality:
- Loading and parsing the JSON metadata
- Building efficient mappings between words and videos
- Looking up videos for specific words
- Getting random videos for testing
- Checking video availability

```python
# Example dataset access
dataset = WLASLDataset(json_path, videos_dir)
video_filename = dataset.get_video_for_word("hello")
video_path = dataset.get_video_path(video_filename)
```

## Web Application Architecture

The web interface is built using:
- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript
- **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

### API Endpoints
- `/api/word-video`: Get a video for a specific word
- `/api/word-list`: Get a list of all available words
- `/api/word-list-progress`: Stream progress updates during word list generation
- `/api/sentence-video`: Convert a sentence to an ASL video
- `/api/video-to-text`: Recognize signs from an uploaded video

### Web UI Components
- **Word Lookup**: Search and display individual word videos
- **Sentence Conversion**: Enter sentences and see ASL videos with gloss
- **Video Upload**: Upload and analyze ASL videos
- **Word Browser**: Browse all available words with real-time search

## Performance Considerations

### Video Processing Optimizations
- **Video Caching**: Generated videos are cached to avoid repeated processing
- **Progressive Loading**: Word lists are loaded with progress indicators
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple word videos can be processed concurrently

### Memory Management
- **Temporary File Handling**: Videos are processed in temporary directories and cleaned up after use
- **Resource Cleanup**: Video file handles are properly closed after use
- **Selective Loading**: Only required video frames are loaded into memory

## Development Best Practices

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features work with partial dataset availability
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and processing status updates
- **Exception Management**: Proper try/except blocks with specific error handling

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Resource Limitations**: Video size and processing limits prevent DoS issues
- **Temporary File Security**: Files are created with secure permissions in isolated directories

## Potential Enhancements

### Text Processing Improvements
- **Advanced NLP**: More sophisticated language understanding for better glossing
- **ASL Grammar Rules**: Implementing proper ASL grammar instead of simplified gloss
- **Contextual Processing**: Handling homonyms and context-dependent signs

### Video Enhancement
- **Style Transfer**: Creating visual consistency between different signers
- **Speed Normalization**: Adjusting video playback speed for natural rhythm
- **Non-manual Features**: Adding facial expressions and body language

### Recognition Enhancements
- **Continuous Sign Recognition**: Handling connected signing without clear word boundaries
- **Signer Independence**: Improving recognition across different signers
- **Context Awareness**: Using sentence context to improve recognition accuracy

## Dataset Limitations

- **Vocabulary Coverage**: Limited to words in the WLASL dataset
- **Visual Consistency**: Different signers with different styles
- **Regional Variations**: ASL has regional variations not fully captured
- **Expression Limitations**: Non-manual components (facial expressions, body language) are not systematically indexed

## Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**: Core programming language
- **MoviePy**: For video processing and concatenation
- **OpenCV**: For frame-level video analysis
- **Flask**: For web application backend
- **Modern Browser**: With HTML5 video support for the frontend
